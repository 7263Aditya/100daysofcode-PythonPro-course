#Conditional Statements

# if
# elif
# else
# and
# or
# not
# x = 10
# y = 20
# if x > y:
#     print("x is greater than y")
# elif x < y:
#     print("x is less than y")
# else:
#     print("x and y are equal")

# print(not (x == y))  # True because it's the opposite of    
# "if x equals y" which is false. So, "not (x==y)" will be true.
# Nested Conditionals

# if condition:
#     do this
# else:
#     do that

# Example

# if x == y:
#     print("x and y are equal")
# else:
#     if x < y:
#         print("x is less than y")
#     else:
#         print("x is greater than y")

#Comparison operators

# == equal to
# != not equal
